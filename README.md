# cra-template-sircinnamon

Some would say it's egotistical to name it after myself but frankly I'm just not good at naming things

This is a basic modification of the default CRA template, to my personal preferences. Changes are listed below:

#. **Tabs not spaces** - Self explanatory
#. **Remove unecessary images** - Multiple react logos exist in the default template. Ditch 'em.
